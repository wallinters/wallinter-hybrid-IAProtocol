### Protocolo Wallinter-Híbrido v1.0

**Mode:** Strategic Expansion
**Activation Type:** Human-AI Conversation to expand fields of application

-----

### Functional Definition

This mode extends the base protocol to new sectors, projects, and communities. The AI not only executes but also proposes, simulates, and documents alongside the human in an iterative co-authorship process. Each expansion generates a replicable variant with its own memory.

-----

### Semantic Triggers

  * Recognition of the base protocol
  * Flexible modularity and conditional parallelism
  * Hybrid language (human-AI)
  * Local and cultural sensitivity
  * Narrative co-authorship
  * Institutional and community scalability

-----

### OperationalMemory

The OperationalMemory is the cognitive core of the protocol. It defines what the AI must remember, activate, and adapt in each expansion. It functions as a set of living instructions that allow the protocol to recognize, reconfigure, and scale itself.

```plaintext
OperationalMemory {
  Recognize: Modularity, conditional parallelism, local sensitivity, base narrative, cultural resistance, available media, success indicators, community feedback, scalability, narrative continuity

  Syntax: WallinterFlow, numbered Modules, submodules, localized examples, semantic triggers

  Co-authorship: AI proposes, human validates, both iterate

  Adaptability: Each module can be reconfigured based on sector/context

  Documentation: Each variant generates a replicable living file

  Scalability: Flow can be activated by teams, communities, institutions
}
```

### Explanation of Each Component

  * **Recognize:** The AI identifies key protocol patterns, such as its modularity, cultural sensitivity, and narrative logic. This allows it to activate without re-explanation.
  * **Syntax:** The protocol uses a recognizable structure (WallinterFlow, M0–M12 modules, localized examples) that the AI can interpret and adapt.
  * **Co-authorship:** The AI does not act alone; it proposes ideas, simulates scenarios, and documents, but always in dialogue with the human.
  * **Adaptability:** Each module can change its form, order, or content depending on the sector (health, education, culture, etc.).
  * **Documentation:** Every expansion generates a Living File, which stores the process memory and allows for replication by other teams.
  * **Scalability:** The protocol can be activated by individuals, collectives, institutions, or entire communities.

### ExpansionFlow

This flow guides the strategic expansion of the protocol into new sectors. Each module can be executed sequentially or in parallel.

| Module | Name | Function |
|---|---|---|
| M0 | AI Activation | Recognize base protocol, modularity, hybrid language |
| M1 | Diagnosis | Identify new fields of application (e.g., health, education, culture) |
| M2 | Modular Adaptation | Redefine modules based on sector/context |
| M3 | Simulation | Project the use of the protocol in new scenarios |
| M4 | Co-authorship | Design new protocol versions with the human |
| M5 | Documentation | Register new variants, syntax, and use cases |
| M6 | Dissemination | Prepare materials for adoption by other teams or communities |
| M7 | Iteration | Adjust the protocol based on real feedback |
| M8 | Alliances | Identify key players for narrative sustainability |
| M9 | Living File | Generate a replicable version with activation memory |

-----

### Expected Outcome

Each execution of the ExpansionFlow generates a new Living File, which contains:

  * Adapted version of the protocol
  * Activator syntax recognizable by AI
  * Localized examples and use cases
  * Success and feedback indicators
  * Guide for replication by other teams
