  Type: "Project in execution",
  Process: "Break down by modules. Activate as a multitask flow with conditional parallelism.",
  Sequence: "Modules 0, 1, and 2 are prerequisites to execute 3 through 11.",
  
  Modules {
    0: AI Activation → "Recognize flow, modularity, parallelism, local sensitivity. Do not execute subsequent modules without completing 1 and 2.",
    1: Identity → "Define project name, purpose, key stakeholders. E.g., 'Conservation of pollinators in urban areas'.",
    2: Terrain → "Map physical, social, and symbolic environment. E.g., 'Rural schools in Chiapas, community perception'.",
    3: Content → "Establish messages, narratives, key data. E.g., 'Importance of pollinators, myths, ecological benefits'.",
    4: Media → "Select channels and formats. E.g., ['Social media', 'School posters', 'Community talks'].",
    5: Simulation → "Anticipate scenarios and reactions. E.g., ['What would happen if pollinators disappear?', 'How would the community react?'].",
    6: Metrics → "Define impact indicators. E.g., ['Student participation', 'Reactions on social media', 'Message comprehension'].",
    7: Generation → "Produce actionable content. E.g., 'Create 2 short texts, 1 activator image, 1 school audio clip'.",
    8: Activation → "Launch actions in the field. E.g., 'School event + local social media dissemination'.",
    9: Feedback → "Gather responses and learnings. E.g., 'Opinions from students and teachers'.",
    10: Iteration → "Adjust the flow based on results. E.g., 'Modify content based on comprehension and reception'.",
